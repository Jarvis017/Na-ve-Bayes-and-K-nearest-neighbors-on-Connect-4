# Naive Bayes and Knearest neighbors on Abalone
performance of na√Øve Bayes and k nearest neighbors on the Abalone dataset

# About the project

In this project, the naive Bayes model was implemented using the scikit-learn library. The k nearest neighbors model was implemented using the NearestNeighbors class in the scikit-learn library. also there are Classification Report and Confusion Matrix for each model's result.
